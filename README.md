This time: Rust.

Some day-specific notes:
- Day 20 part B was awful, requiring making assumptions about the input.
- Day 21 part B was even more awful, not only requiring assumptions about the input,
    but also more math than code. I can't be arsed to implement this.
- Day 24 part B - no clue how to solve this without a linear algebra solver.
    That's why this part is implemented in Python, with the use of [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/).
